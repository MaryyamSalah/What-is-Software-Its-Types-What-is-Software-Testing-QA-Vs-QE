What's Software?

Software is used to control a computer. There are different types of software that can run on a computer: system software, utility software, and application software.

The 3 types of computer software:

1. System software

If you think of software as being in layers, the system software is the bottom layer: it sits between the hardware and the application software.
Operating systems like Windows, macOS, Android and iOS are examples of system software. Operating systems are loaded into RAM when the device starts up, and have access to the hard drive.


2. Utility software
Utility software is part of the system software and performs specific tasks to keep the computer running. Utility software is always running in the background. Examples of utility software are security and optimization programs.

Security programs include anti-virus software that scans and removes viruses. Most computers will include some sort of anti-virus software, but you can add your own.

Optimization programs can include tools for system clean-up, disk defragmentation, and file compression. These tools are typically installed as part of the operating system. They have access to the hard drive to keep it tidy.

3. Application software
This is everything else! Anything that is not an operating system or a utility is an application or app. So a word processor, spreadsheet, web browser, and graphics software are all examples of application software, and they can do many specific tasks.


 What is Software Testing?

Software testing is an important process in the software development lifecycle . It involves verifying and validating that a software application is free of bugs, meets the technical requirements set by its design and development , and satisfies user requirements efficiently and effectively.

Quality Assurance Vs. Quality Engineering:

Quality assurance (QA) aims to identify errors in the final product to confirm that it adheres to quality standards. Quality engineering (QE) focuses on preventing defects from occurring to ensure quality throughout the development lifecycle.

QA, emphasizing manual testing and exploratory techniques, provides the essential groundwork for identifying issues early in development. On the other hand, QE, or quality engineering, leverages automation and performance testing to examine the productâ€™s quality deeply.
